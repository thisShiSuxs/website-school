  <h3>About</h3>
  <h1>Something about Sharky</h1>
  <p> <img src="IMG_2802.JPG">
   This is Sharky, a spirited high school shark with an insatiable appetite for creativity. Whether they’re capturing the perfect shot through their camera lens, sketching in their well-worn sketchbook, or building something entirely new from scratch, Sharky is always in their element when creating. Photography, in particular, has become more than just a hobby—it’s a way of seeing the world, freezing moments that might otherwise slip away unnoticed.
Some people playfully describe Sharky as a “passionate duck,” a quirky nickname that emerged from their enthusiastic nature and tendency to dive headfirst into whatever interests them. But Sharky sees themself quite differently: as a friendly, talkative, and reliable shark who genuinely enjoys connecting with others and being there when friends need support. They’re the kind of person who remembers the small details in conversations and always follows through on their promises.
Now, as a grade 12 shark standing at the threshold of the next big chapter, Sharky faces an exciting challenge: applying to their dream university. This isn’t just any university—it’s perfectly situated near the Pacific Ocean, where the sound of waves and the salty breeze would become part of daily life. Imagine studying marine biology or environmental science with the ocean right there, or simply being able to photograph sunsets over the water whenever inspiration strikes. It’s everything Sharky has been working toward.
The transcripts? Already submitted, check. But then came the curveball: the university wants a comprehensive overview of all extracurricular activities too. Oh no. While Sharky has been plenty busy with clubs, projects, volunteer work, and creative pursuits, everything has been scattered across different platforms, folders, and memory cards. There was no central place to see it all together.
That’s exactly why this website exists. Rather than sending a simple list or boring document, Sharky decided to create something more authentic—a digital portfolio that truly captures who they are. Here, you’ll find not just a catalog of extracurricular activities, but a genuine glimpse into Sharky’s hobbies, personality, creative work, and the journey that has shaped them into the shark they are today. Welcome to Sharky’s world.</p>
